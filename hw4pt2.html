<!-- 
You will create a web page to show to interested clients how the compound interest works.

As soon as you open that web page on the browser to the client, it will have a heading such as "Learn about compound interest"

Below the heading you will code a script to show 3 tables with the calculation of compound interest on a principal of $1000.

The first table will be for the interest rate of 5%
The second table will be for the interest rate of 6%
The third table will be for the interest rate of 7%
Each of the tables will show the rows from year 1 through 5.

The formula to calculate the compound interest is: A = P(1 + r)n where:

P is the principal (the initial amount you borrow or deposit)
r is the annual rate of interest (percentage) that, for 5% for example, would be 0.05
n is the number of years the amount is deposited
A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest
The table will look like what is shown here below (the table below is showing only the first 4 years and for only the 5% interest rate):

The first column will have the number for the year
The second column will have the Amount calculated, based on that formula for that year
The third column will have the interest rate that is being used

Year	Amount on deposit	Interest Rate
1	1050.00	0.05
2	1102.50	0.05
3	1157.63	0.05
4	1215.51	0.05
There is NO INPUT for this problem! The 3 tables (one for 5%, another for 6% and another for 7%) should be shown as soon as the page is opened (loaded in the browser).

IMPORTANT TIP: The more efficient way to resolve this problem is to make one loop inside the other (nested loop). It is not ok if you set the 3 tables first and then loop to write only the results on the tables! Think about future maintenance - for example, if the company requests to show one more table for another interest rate, or if it is requested to present 10 years, instead of 5 for each interest rate. The less places you have to modify, the better your code is considered. So, use nested loop

MORE FOR THIS TIP: the outside loop should be for the interest rate that will start a new table tag and the top part of the table (table headings), then the internal loop should be for each year to build the rows of that table!

You should use jQuery or CSS to alternate the background colors of the rows - whatever colors you want - it does not need to follow the format shown here
TIP: If using CSS, you can think about nth-of-child pseudo-class for the tr tag!
